# Full-Stack To-Do App

After cloning, set up environment and install dependencies for both frontend and backend development:
* `gradle eclipse`
* `cd src/main/resources && npm install`

To run Jest tests, ensure you are in the `src/main/resources` directory and have run `npm install` to download your Node.js dependencies. This will produce a `node_modules` directory. You can run `npm test` from your `src/main/resources` directory to test your JavaScript code.
